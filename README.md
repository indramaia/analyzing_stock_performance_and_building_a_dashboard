Analyzing Stock Performance and Building a Dashboard

### Use a Python library to obtain financial data. You will extract historical stock data using yfinance. 

!pip install yfinance==0.1.67
!pip install pandas==1.3.3
--
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

### Extracting Stock Data Using Web Scraping
## Install BeautifulSoup. On the attachments you can check the Intro to Webscraping Using BeautifulSoup lab notebook (.ipynb file).
Not all stock data required for this project is available via a library. Here we use web scraping to obtain financial data and extract historical stock data from a web-page using beautiful soup.
